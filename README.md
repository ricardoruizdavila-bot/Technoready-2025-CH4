Proyect about Non-Relational Databases for Storing JSON Data from digital now

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ“¦ OBJETIVE</summary>

The project consists of transforming a restaurant directory platform to offer users a personalized and dynamic experience. To achieve this, non-relational databasesâ€”specifically MongoDBâ€”will be used to store data in JSON format. Additionally, a RESTful API will be developed using Express.js to enable interaction with this data.

This sprint focuses on setting up the MongoDB database for the Tattler Restaurant Directory, designed to offer personalized and dynamic restaurant experiences.
The goal is to store restaurant data in a non-relational structure (JSON) and prepare it for later interaction through a RESTful API with Express.js.

Install MongoDB and Compass
Download and install MongoDB Community Server
Make sure to include MongoDB Database Tools (required for mongoimport).
    
    Create the Database
Open MongoDB Compass
