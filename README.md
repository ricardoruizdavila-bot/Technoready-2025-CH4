Proyect about Non-Relational Databases for Storing JSON Data from digital now

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ“¦ OBJETIVE</summary>

The project consists of transforming a restaurant directory platform to offer users a personalized and dynamic experience. To achieve this, non-relational databasesâ€”specifically MongoDBâ€”will be used to store data in JSON format. Additionally, a RESTful API will be developed using Express.js to enable interaction with this data.

This sprint focuses on setting up the MongoDB database for the Tattler Restaurant Directory, designed to offer personalized and dynamic restaurant experiences.
The goal is to store restaurant data in a non-relational structure (JSON) and prepare it for later interaction through a RESTful API with Express.js.

## Installation & Usage
    
Install MongoDB and Compass
Download and install MongoDB Community Server
Make sure to include MongoDB Database Tools (required for mongoimport).
    
    Create the Database
Open MongoDB Compass
Connect to mongodb://localhost:27017
Create a database named restaurants
Create a collection named restaurants

    MongoDB Configuration

Database name: restaurants

Develop a RESTful API using Express.js and MongoDB, conducting tests in Postman or Insomnia (in this case postman) to verify the proper functioning of the API, and upload it to the GitHub repository.

  <summary>ðŸ“¦ SPRINT 3</summary>

For this sprint, there weren't many changes; only search parameters and filters were added when searching for certain restaurants.

## New

Added support for sorting (sort), field selection (fields), pagination (limit, page), and response format (format).
The filter and sorting options are built dynamically based on the query parameters.
Debug logs were added to help with troubleshooting and to show clear messages when no results are found.

Test in Postman
```
Serach for word
GET http://localhost:3000/api/restaurants?search=pizz
```
```
Search for stile of food
GET http://localhost:3000/api/restaurants?search=italiano
```
```
Search for review (number):
GET http://localhost:3000/api/restaurants?search=4.4
```
```
Search for revier descend
